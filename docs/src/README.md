# Proof debugger

This is a proof debugger for
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
that makes it easy to debug proof counterexamples produced by
[CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and
[Kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) on C and Rust code.

To get started, see our
* [installation instructions](installation.md) and a
* [simple demonstration](demo) of how to use the proof debugger.
