# Demonstration

Follow the [installation instructions](../installation.md) to install the
proof debugger if you have not already done so.
These instructions will clone the source tree into the directory
`proof-debugger` and install the debugger into Visual Studio Code.

Change to the directory `proof-debugger/demo`.

This directory contains a simple project consisting of a
[Makefile](proof-debugger/demo/Makefile) and two source files
[foo.c](demo/foo.c) and [main.c](demo/main.c).
